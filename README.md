My very first Android app that I can consider complete. It's a simple calculator app with additional features otakus might like, like the doujin code vault and able to set calculator background. We may wanna calculate how many waifus we already had. ðŸ˜‚

PS.: It does't have the said features yet. It doesn't also have any special function same as a full calcultor app like scientific functions and other stuff 'coz I'm still learning Android development.

<br>

## Basic Usage

It works just like how a simple calculator works.

Hiding/accessing codes:

- To hide doujin codes, type the code on the calculator. Press-and-hold on the final digit and it will be stored code vault.

- To access the vault:
press-and-hold the `DECIMAL` button.

Vault password:

- Access the vault, then click the tri-dot menu and select `Settings > Password`. There you set/change/remove vault password.

<br />

## Plan for updates

- App icon ('coz I'm using nHentai logo. yikes)
- More sci-fi like UI
- Background
- Convertions
- Open doujin codes to browser
